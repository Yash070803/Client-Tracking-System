# Client-Tracking-System
Client Tracking System: A full-stack web app with a Django REST API backend (JWT auth, SQLite) and a React frontend. Normal users can only view limited client data in a styled table stored in DB, while admins can view complete data, edit and delete it as well. Features role-based access, separate frontend/backend, and professional UI styling.
